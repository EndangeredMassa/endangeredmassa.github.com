Welcome to Phase 5: Make Decision! In this phase we'll make our final decision.

---


The information gathered so far was focused on the candidate's strengths that match the employer's needs. If the candidate did well in the selected areas, you can be more confident that you've seen them at their best. If they did not, maybe they aren't as strong in those areas as they think they are.

This candidate looks like a great fit. They have several useful strengths and even more skills that we need in this role. We decide to hire them and make them an offer.
