Let's explore those topics in more detail.

**Work:** Discuss the current working environment including culture, physical/remote space, collaboration, and project management. Discuss the candidates preferences in those areas.

**Growth:** Discuss where the candidate believes they are in their career and skillsets. Discuss where they'd like to go in the future.

**Direction:** Discuss where the company is heading from both a product and business perspective.

**Compensation:** Discuss the compensation expectations of the candidate and the compensation range of the position. Include stock, bonus, and benefits. Make it clear that you do not discuss compensation history.

**Deal Breakers:** Discuss any absolute requirements that either you have for the candidate or they have for employment. These must be clearly discussed in this phase.

Near the end of the call, remind the candidate of the next steps. Ask them if they have any final questions.

Make note of any follow up tasks you may want to do before deciding to bring them in for an interview. These could be calling references, reviewing work samples, confirming details of employment you didn't have at hand for the candidate, etc.

After completing your follow ups, you should be certain that a candidate should or should not progress to the next phase. If you are not, you either have more follow ups to do or make a decision with what you have.

If you are low on interviewable candidates, this is a hard to fill position, or you suspect your biases are making you hesitant, consider progressing the candidate to the next stage. If you already have a lot of interviews or the position is not hard to fill, consider passing on the candidate.

> Pros:
> - have a background that roughly matches our tech stack
> - seem very interested in what we're building
> - appreciate our approach to recruiting and performance reviews
> - have a growth mindset
>
> Cons:
> - never worked full-time remotely before
> - tech skillset doesn't include Ember
>
> The pros are strong and the cons can be addressed relatively easily, except maybe managing the transition to remote work. We can certainly offer support and guidance here, but success in that area will ultimately come from within. After talking to their past colleague Ashish about working remote with the candidate for brief periods of time, they did affirm that communication was frequent and detailed. No concerns were raised about this arrangement.
>
> Decision: This candidate looks like a good initial match for the team. Let's bring them in for the interview!
