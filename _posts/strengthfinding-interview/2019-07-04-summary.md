That's the Strength-finding Interview! I hope you find this useful.

This is the result of research, experimentation, and iteration across years of work, quite often in collaboration with [@Trek](https://twitter.com/trek). You can read [Trek's earlier take](https://medium.com/@trek/tired-engineering-interviews-hired-engineering-auditions-5f9f00147a57) on this format, as well.

I consider this to be an evolving process. If you have questions or feedback, please let me know! Please send it to [@endangeredmassa](https://twitter.com/endangeredmassa) or [endangeredmassa@gmail.com](mailto:endangeredmassa@gmail.com).


## Feedback from Candidates So Far

Candidate feedback on the process for both those who were successful and those who weren't has been outstanding. Everyone appreciated the goals of the format as well as the execution of it.

As interviewers, we felt much more confident in our offers and rejections. On rejections specifically: it was compelling to see a candidate claim a specific strength, us to shape the interview around that strength, then the evaluation come back as sub-par for that strength.

When we reject someone, we try to give some notes about why. There's potential legal risk in these kinds of conversations--so have them with care and approval from the responsible parties in your organization. If you can provide feedback to rejected candidates, please do so.

When we accept someone, we try to use this assessment as a starting point for their internal continuous improvement through performance management. We plan to get to a place where the interview counts as a partial assessment in the performance management cycle. But, that's a topic for another time.
