I've often been a part of hiring decisions where the candidate:

- was great at several things, but none of those were assessed
- was assessed for things that didn't matter to the job
- was clearly nervous, but no accommodation was provided
- was not hired, but went on to do amazing things at an other, similar job

Over the years, I've grown skeptical of the whole affair. I'm not alone. You can consume countless articles, books, research studies, podcasts, and conference talks about the broken hiring process. Many alternatives have been suggested, all of which seem to pick a difference balance point in the tradeoffs of time, accuracy, and fairness.

What follows is my own approach to solving this problem. I've researched, experimented, and collaborated on this over hears. I claim no academic authority on the matter, but this series describes where my research and experience have led me.


# Where I'm At

Most interviews seem to be accidental (idealistic) Me-finding Interviews: the interviewers are looking for others who share their values, virtues, and unknowingly their vices. The format is also often very rigid, looking for specific things and rejecting candidates who can't demonstrate them.

Me-finding characteristics, intentional or otherwise:

- requiring a college degree, just like me
- requiring a take-home test or a lengthy interview process, just like me who has no kids or family obligations
- requiring whiteboard coding, just like me?
- requiring X years experience in a specific technology, just like me
- requiring similar interests as me, so we can go out for a drink sometime

What follows is a distillation of the process I use for interviewing. If you agree with the goals of this format, feel free to use it as a starting point in your own interview process. Hopefully, it can serve you as a better default.

So far, variations of this format have been tested across 2 companies, 94 phone screens, 27 interviews, 14 offers, and 9 hires. False negatives are impossible to track, but confidence in no-hire decisions was very high. False positives were extremely low. Roughly half of all candidates provided unsolicited feedback and it has always (so far) been positive, even from those we declined.

# Goals

What makes this process different from traditional interview practices is that it aims to find the overlap between your team's needs and a candidate's strengths, then plans the specific candidate's interview to highlight those strengths.

The other goals are to:
- be as accurate as possible within the constraints of time expectations
- remove as much bias as possible from the process
- provide a fair and consistent experience to candidates
- be transparent throughout

You may notice that "plan the specific candidate's interview" and "provide a ... consistent experience to candidates" are at odds, but we'll explore how to balance those.


# Summary (tl;dr)

The key takeaways are:

- ask the candidate what their strengths are, then tailor the interview towards the overlap between those and your needs
- be flexible in format, tech stack, and time
- be consistent wherever possible

# Process

TBD: module development


# The End

That's the Strength-finding Interview! I hope you find this useful.

This is the result of research, experimentation, and iteration across years of work, quite often in collaboration with [@Trek](https://twitter.com/trek). You can read [Trek's earlier take](https://medium.com/@trek/tired-engineering-interviews-hired-engineering-auditions-5f9f00147a57) on this format, as well.

I consider this to be an evolving process. If you have questions or feedback, please let me know! Please send it to [@endangeredmassa](https://twitter.com/endangeredmassa) or [endangeredmassa@gmail.com](mailto:endangeredmassa@gmail.com).


## Feedback from Candidates So Far

Candidate feedback on the process for both those who were successful and those who weren't has been outstanding. Everyone appreciated the goals of the format as well as the execution of it.

As interviewers, we felt much more confident in our offers and rejections. On rejections specifically: it was compelling to see a candidate claim a specific strength, us to shape the interview around that strength, then the evaluation come back as sub-par for that strength.

When we reject someone, we try to give some notes about why. There's potential legal risk in these kinds of conversations--so have them with care and approval from the responsible parties in your organization. If you can provide feedback to rejected candidates, please do so.

When we accept someone, we try to use this assessment as a starting point for their internal continuous improvement through performance management. We plan to get to a place where the interview counts as a partial assessment in the performance management cycle. But, that's a topic for another time.
