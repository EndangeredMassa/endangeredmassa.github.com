<!--
TO DO:
- ensure scorecard through-line is clear
- put in a couple modules
- link relevant research
-->

Most interviews seem to be Me-finding Interviews: the interviewers are looking for others who share their values, virtues, and unknowingly their vices. The format is also often very rigid, looking for specific things and rejecting candidates who can't demonstrate them.

I think we can do better. I know many are trying, too! I'm not setting up a straw man here. I just want to share my take on doing better.

What follows is (hopefully) a better default. If you agree with the goals of this format, feel free to use it as a starting point in your own interview process.


## Goals

The differentiating goal is to find the overlap between your team's needs and a candidate's strengths, then plan the specific candidate's interview to highlight those strengths.

The other goals are to:
- be as accurate as possible within the constraints of time expectations
- remove as much bias as possible from the process
- provide a fair and consistent experience to candidates
- be transparent throughout

You may notice that "plan the specific candidate's interview" and "provide a ... consistent experience to candidates" are at odds, but we'll explore a compromise below.


## Summary (tl;dr)

The key takeaways are:

- ask the candidate what their strengths are, then tailor the interview towards the overlap between those and your needs
- be flexible in format, tech stack, and time
- be consistent wherever possible

who is applying for this Software Engineer job:


<details open>
<summary>üìã <b>Job: Software Engineer</b></summary>

> FlashRecruit is a funded recruitment technology startup with massive traction (SaaS based) looking for a Software Engineer (for full stack development) to join our growing team! We're building chat-based (and other) software to make the job seeking and recruiting experiences better.
>
> **Opportunity**
>
> You are invited to join us on this adventure! There is a unique opportunity here to not only be a part of what we're building, but to influence the direction we take. You will be able to contribute your different skill sets to the various problems we'll solve together.
>
> In this role specifically, you'll be collaborating with the development team to build new features, new products, and iterate on our processes. These efforts will directly lead to happier customers and more sales for the business.
>
> We'd love to tell you more about what to expect, but the team is small and growing. It's hard to predict what the future will hold. Joining now gives you an opportunity to shape that future.
>
> **Context**
>
> We work in the recruiting software landscape, which is complex and crowded. We're doing something unique in the space by offering the ability to chat with a recruiter before applying to a job, which is exciting. We're not stopping there.
>
> We're also a small startup, which means you'll likely wear different hats at different times. We expect you to spend most of your time writing software, but sometimes other related hats will be necessary.
>
> We have an office in Oakbrook, which you are free to use if you like, but the engineering team is fully remote. The company fully embraces remote work. You will be collaborating with others that could be working anywhere in the US (for now). Because of this, communication is key. This includes screen sharing, remote pair programming, writing documentation, virtual meetings, and more.
>
> **Expectations of You**
>
> There aren't many technical requirements. We don't want to exclude you based on something you could learn quickly enough on the job. Instead, we'd like to focus on the skills that we find to be critical to happiness and success in self and team.
>
> **Continuous Improvement:** For each other item, you don't have to already be great. The core expectation and real requirement is that you improve over time. The processes and expectations in place will facilitate that, but you should be motivated to continuous improvement as well.
>
> **Code:** Writing software is the core of this role. You should write software that is tested, modifiable, and clear. We have no expectations around computer science concepts, but you should be open to learning about anything relevant to the work.
>
> **Worked on Web Software:** You should have built web applications or the systems supporting them before. Experience with our entire stack is not necessary. It is helpful to have some experience with at least one of these:
>
> *   Node.js (API)
> *   Ember (Web Client)
> *   React Native (Mobile Apps)
> *   Heroku/S3/RDS (Infrastructure)
>
> **Collaborate:** You should work well in a collaborative environment. As a team, we'll be building software, reviewing code, deciding on architecture, and iterating on our processes. You don't have to do all of these things, but we'd like you to be involved with the team more than just executing individual task after task.
>
> **Write:** Because we fully embrace remote work, you will often be writing messages, pull request descriptions, the occasional document, and more. Technical Writing is an important skill in general, but especially in a remote environment.
>
> **Give Feedback:** You should give feedback on the product, team, and team members. Feedback should be specific, actionable, and timely. For individuals, it should also be directly related to the job they are expected to perform. You should also be mindful or biases when giving feedback.
>
> **Receive Feedback:** You should respond well to valid feedback. Responding well can mean many things, including disagreement. We want to build a strong, trust-and-respect-based relationship across the team that allows us to give feedback about actions, not judgements about people.
>
> **Benefits**
>
> *   Competitive compensation
> *   Equity in a funded, early-stage startup poised for exponential growth
> *   Full-time W2 employment
> *   Health Care Plan that's good for families and individuals
> *   Flexible time to allow for a work-life balance that works for you and your family
> *   Minimum Required PTO with suggested 4-weeks per year
> *   Intentionally Guided Culture based on inclusion and respect
> *   Remote work
>
> If you aren't sure if you should apply, please apply anyway. Don't self-select yourself out. We'd be happy to discuss any concerns you have with the job post matching your skill set.
>
> FlashRecruit is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

# Interview Process

There are five phases to the process. They will look pretty typical, but the details are a bit more unique.

```
Phase 1: Confirm Expectations
Phase 2: Interview Negotiation
Phase 3: Strength Finding Interview
Phase 4: Review and Follow Ups
Phase 5: Make a Decision
```


## Phase 1: Confirm Expectations

*Phase Goal: Confirm expectations of the candidate and employer regarding the work, growth, and compensation.*

Schedule a 30-minute call to with the candidate to discuss the work environment, growth of the candidate, direction of the business, and compensation expectations.

Let's explore those topics in more detail.

**Work:** Discuss the current working environment including culture, physical/remote space, collaboration, and project management. Discuss the candidates preferences in those areas.

**Growth:** Discuss where the candidate believes they are in their career and skillsets. Discuss where they'd like to go in the future.

**Direction:** Discuss where the company is heading from both a product and business perspective.

**Compensation:** Discuss the compensation expectations of the candidate and the compensation range of the position. Include stock, bonus, and benefits. Make it clear that you do not discuss compensation history.

**Deal Breakers:** Discuss any absolute requirements that either you have for the candidate or they have for employment. These must be clearly discussed in this phase.

Near the end of the call, remind the candidate of the next steps. Ask them if they have any final questions.

Make note of any follow up tasks you may want to do before deciding to bring them in for an interview. These could be calling references, reviewing work samples, confirming details of employment you didn't have at hand for the candidate, etc.

After completing your follow ups, you should be certain that a candidate should or should not progress to the next phase. If you are not, you either have more follow ups to do or should decide on leaning towards interviewing less qualified candidates or not interviewing qualified candidates.

If you are low on interviewable candidates, this is a hard to fill position, or you suspect your biases are making you hesitant, consider progressing the candidate to the next stage. If you already have a lot of interviews or the position is not hard to fill, consider passing on the candidate.

We can certainly offer support and guidance here, but success in that area will ultimately come from within. After talking to their past colleague Ashish about working remote with the candidate for brief periods of time, they did affirm that communication was frequent and detailed. No concerns were raised about this arrangement.

> Decision: This candidate looks like a good initial match for the team. Let's bring them in for the interview!

</details>


## Phase 2: Interview Negotiation

*Phase Goal: Assess the candidate at their best in a well-structured, fair way.*


### Collaborate on the Format

As a candidate, have you ever missed out on a job and thought "If only I could have shown them my skill in X"? As part of a hiring decision, have you ever declined a candidate who went somewhere else and performed very well? There are certainly cases where it still wouldn't have worked out if the candidate was hired in these situations, but they should certainly be making it through the process more often.

This phase starts with a request for information from the candidate. The request boils down to "what are your strengths that overlap with our needs?"

The candidate will respond with their strengths. If they shared some relevant strengths, select a couple to build into the interview. If not, either (1) select less relevant strengths as a way to assess their ability to master something or (2) follow up with them to see if there are other strengths you could focus on.

### Interview Modules

Interview Modules are how you can find balance between consistent and adaptive interview experiences for candidates. The format is flexible around which modules are chosen, but a given module should remain as consistent as possible across candidates.

**Selection:** Some modules will still apply to most candidates. In our interviews, we typically do the same 2 modules for everyone, then leave room for 2 other modules to be flexible towards the candidate's strengths. Modules should also span technical implementation skills as well as collaboration/communication skills.

**Format:** Collaboration is very important. If the candidate is comfortable with it, try to make at least 1 large module involve collaboration with a team member. That doesn't have to be live coding in a high-pressure situation. Collaboration could be talking through an architectural design, planning a project, triaging (not necessarily fixing) a bug, or the like.

**Construction:** As you use this process more, you'll build more and more modules. This will require some work, but it's also worth the effort. When building modules, try to make them as realistic as possible. The domain should be the same or analogous to your domain by default, although you can shift this per candidate too. The tasks should be representative of the work required to do the job. Try to be flexible on technology choices, as well. Candidates will do a better job if they can pick tools they know to solve a problem.

For our job, we could really use someone with strong API Design and high-quality execution. We also want to assess how well they will work in a remote environment.

Let's set up an interview that highlights the candidate's "API Design" and "Testing". We already asked for a technical writing sample and the homework problem includes a writing section as well. We can dig further into how well the candidate works in a remote environment during the Q&A.

Now that we have the format agreed upon, we can construct the assessment scorecard for this candidate. We'll use this scorecard to assess the candidate. I'll discuss it more in a later section, but for now, let's translate the modules into assessments.

Each module can assess multiple skills, some deeply and others less so. There can also be a lot of overlap. A scorecard format helps us gather notes from multiple sources about a specific skill.

Below are the modules we're going to run along with the skills we can capture signals for in those modules.

- **Homework Discussion: Chat App**
    - UI Component Architecture
    - UI Component Development
    - Testing
    - CSS Implementation
    - Technical Writing
    - Breaking Down Tasks
    - Maintainable Code
- **Collaborate: API Design**
    - API Design
    - Testing
    - Technical Writing
    - Collaboration
- **Collaborate: Refactoring and Testing**
    - Refactoring
    - Testing
    - Working with Existing Code
    - Culture: Empathy and Understanding for Past Decisions
    - Collaboration
    - Maintainable Code
- **Two-directional Q&A**
    - Giving Feedback
    - Receiving Feedback
    - Remote Work
    - Collaboration
    - Continuous Learning

We'll use this to take notes during Phase 3.


## Phase 3: Strength-finding Interview

Now we run the actual interview. This phase includes your common interview fare. You have a schedule, you meet, you discuss, you collaborate, and you evaluate.

In the break before the Two-directional Q&A, review your notes to find areas where you'd like to dig deeper.


<details open>
<summary>üìù <b>Interview Notes: Jessie</b> [Sean]</summary>

**Homework Discussion: Chat App**

- [UI Component Architecture]
    - Components are used for high-level encapsulation, but not much for re-use or low-level encapsulation
    - The templates would read better with more components extracted out
- [UI Component Development]
    - The components themselves were pretty straight-forward
- [Testing]
    - Tests appear to essentially cover all implemented behavior
    - Descriptions clearly describe what is being tested
    - Some identifiers could be a little clearer about what values they contain; `value` is not a great name
- [CSS Implementation]
    - There's only basic styling, which makes sense given how far they made it into the funciontality.
    - Used BEM style and stuck to it throughout
- [Technical Writing]
    - Their writeup was well-reasoned. It described a strong, TDD-focused path forward.
    - It was clear what they had done and why.
    - The document was well formatted with clear and useful headings.
- [Breaking Down Tasks]
    - They made it to the middle of Part 2 with tests for all of the functionality they implemented and minimal styling.
    - It looks like they didn't break the tasks into smaller, vertical pieces given the result and commit messages
- [Maintainable Code]
    - Code looks legible with good identifiers, small-ish functions, and reasonably well modeled data.

**Collaborate: API Design**

- [API Design]
    - Jessie struggled a bit on identifying a good solution to the problem. With some assistance, we arrived at a pretty good solution.
- [Testing]
    - N/A
- [Technical Writing]
    - Diagrams were clear enough for productive discussion
- [Collaboration]
    - We worked well together, both contributing to the solution
    - They explained their understanding well
    - They listened when I was talking
    - At one point, we fell off of a topic, then they circled back to it to see if we were done with it before moving on, which was appreciated

**Collaborate: Refactoring and Testing**

- [Refactoring]
    - Suggested better identifiers, method extractions, dead code elimination.
    - All of their suggestions sounded pretty good to me
- [Testing]
    - We also talked about general testing strategy. They mentioned enjoying writing by Justin Searls [on the topic](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki). They follow the Detroit School TDD methodology.
- [Working with Existing Code]
    - They suggested writing some outside tests first, then refactoring the inside to be more legible.
- [Culture: Empathy and Understanding for Past Decisions]
    - They made no comments about how dumb/whatever the existing solution was
    - When I asked them to think about how the code ended up this way to begin with, they gave a thoughtful answer about possible limited expertise, timelines, or just small changes over time.
- [Collaboration]
    - They ended up driving most of the conversation, which was a great way for me to see how much they knew about the topic, but it didn't lead to a lot of collaboration
- [Maintainable Code]
    - Identified that a specific architecture choice meant that this logic would have many reasons to change, making it harder to maintain
    - We talked a bit about how they like the SOLID principles
    - I mentioned that as a team, we do like to follow SRP and OCP, but the others aren't often discussed explicitly

**Two-directional Q&A**

- [Giving Feedback]
    - N/A
- [Receiving Feedback]
    - Q: Tell us about a time when you received some important feedback. How did you received it? What did you do about it?
        - The tech lead on their project mentioned several times that smaller PRs make things easier to develop and review. The candidate learned this lesson and is now also an advocate for that. They said they like to "aggressively" shrink work to be smaller, accomplishable, deliverable tasks.
- [Remote Work]
    - Q: Tell us about how you manage your time and focus.
        - They use distraction blocking software called [Freedom](https://freedom.to/) to prevent themselves from jumping over to Twitter and getting distracted. They also like working in Pomodoros. Keeping mornings clear of meetings is helpful because they feel most productive then.
- [Collaboration]
    - Q: Tell us about a time when you felt that you didn‚Äôt collaborate well. Why? What did you do about it?
        - There was a coworker they would pair with that would not often contribute to the discussion or code. The candidate received feedback that the coworker wasn't comfortable with TDD and also wasn't comfortable bringing this up to the candidate. After talking it through, they realized that they could be more accommodating to other styles. Now, they try to alternate driver/navigator more often and are more flexible around testing style, while still teaching others about what they find valuable in TDD.
- [Continuous Learning]
    - Q: Tell us about a time when you had to solve a hard software problem. What made it hard? How did you approach solving it?
        - While working in a chat system, agents would talk to customers, but there were also monitors of chats. There could be up to 4-way chats. Monitors could be silent or coaching. Some chat messages could be seen by everyone and others only by staff. There were no tests, making development hard. Debugging was especially difficult.
        - They decided to add a lot of tests around this area. In doing so, they discovered several bugs and made the system easier to maintain. They now champion these TDD, specifically.

</details>

We'll compile our full scorecard at the end.


## Phase 4: Review and Follow Ups

*Phase Goal: Fill in the assessment gaps.*

No matter how much effort you reasonably put into the process, there will be times that Phase 3 does not produce enough information to make a decision. This can come from poor execution of an interview module, poor choice of interview module, candidate nerves getting in the way, or other mishaps.

Review the data gathered from the interview and decide if this candidate is a clear hire, decline, or it's unclear. If it's unclear, figure out what missing information you need. The candidate may also have requests for additional information.

Common follow-ups at this stage include:

- candidate requesting to meet other team members
- hiring manager requesting running a different module
- hiring manager requesting supporting evidence of a skill (artifact of the work, professional reference)

Run any follow-ups and gather any relevant information about them. After that's all run, start over with Phase 4.


### Compile Notes into Final Scorecard

Now we take all of our notes and compile a scorecard. Our notes were mostly structured as activities and skill assessments related to those activities. The scorecard inverts that so we can focus on one skill at a time.

We also try to qualify how representative a specific assessment is of a given skill with a confidence rating.


#### Assessment Confidence

We also temper each assessment with our confidence rating on how well we believe that assessment actually represents their skill. The assessment can have a low, medium, or high level of confidence.

**High:** Assessments with high confidence include those where we worked together with the candidate to solve a problem. Collaboration is a great way to understand what it's going to be like to have the candidate on your team.

**Medium:** Assessments with a medium confidence include work samples, certifications (variable, can be high), discussions about how someone works. These are

**Low:** Assessments with a low confidence include reference calls, unvalidated claims, discussions about how someone works, or otherwise higher confidence assessments that were too short or otherwise incomplete.


#### Culture Assessments

Culture assessments are a special case. It's hard to assess at all, you need to be intentional about your own culture, and you want to be looking for culture add, not culture fit. I won't go into how we do that here, but you should at least be thinking about your own culture and how the candidate could contribute to it.


#### The Scorecard

Here we have our compiled scorecard.

<details open>
<summary>üìù <b>Scorecard: Jessie as Software Engineer</b></summary>

> ### **General Skills**
>
> **Continuous Improvement** [Score: TBD]
> - Two-directional Q&A [Confidence: Medium]
>     - Q: Tell us about a time when you had to solve a hard software problem. What made it hard? How did you approach solving it?
>         - While working in a chat system, agents would talk to customers, but there were also monitors of chats. There could be up to 4-way chats. Monitors could be silent or coaching. Some chat messages could be seen by everyone and others only by staff. There were no tests, making development hard. Debugging was especially difficult.
>         - They decided to add a lot of tests around this area. In doing so, they discovered several bugs and made the system easier to maintain. They now champion these TDD, specifically.
> - Phase 1 Notes
>     - They blog about their learning: {{link to blog}}
>
> **Collaboration** [Score: TBD]
> - Collaborate: API Design [Confidence: High]
>     - We worked well together, both contributing to the solution
>     - They explained their understanding well
>     - They listened when I was talking
>     - At one point, we fell off of a topic, then they circled back to it to see if we were done with it before moving on, which was appreciated
> - Collaborate: Refactoring and Testing [Confidence: High]
>     - They ended up driving most of the conversation, which was a great way for me to see how much they knew about the topic, but it didn't lead to a lot of collaboration
> - Two-directional Q&A [Confidence: Medium]
>     - Q: Tell us about a time when you felt that you didn‚Äôt collaborate well. Why? What did you do about it?
>         - There was a coworker they would pair with that would not often contribute to the discussion or code. The candidate received feedback that the coworker wasn't comfortable with TDD and also wasn't comfortable bringing this up to the candidate. After talking it through, they realized that they could be more accommodating to other styles. Now, they try to alternate driver/navigator more often and are more flexible around testing style, while still teaching others about what they find valuable in TDD.
> - Reference: Ashish [Confidence: Low]
>     - said that Jessie was good to work with: liked to pair and share what they've learned
>
> **Technical Writing** [Score: TBD]
> - Collaborate: API Design [Confidence: High]
>     - Diagrams were clear enough for productive discussion
> - Homework Discussion: Chat App [Confidence: High]
>     - Their writeup was well-reasoned. It described a strong, TDD-focused path forward.
>     - It was clear what they had done and why.
>     - The document was well formatted with clear and useful headings.
> - Phase 1 Notes
>     - {{links to blog posts they submitted}}
>
> **Giving Feedback** [Score: N/A]
> - Two-directional Q&A [Confidence: Medium]
>   - N/A
>
> **Receiving Feedback** [Score: TBD]
> - Two-directional Q&A [Confidence: Medium]
>     - Q: Tell us about a time when you received some important feedback. How did you received it? What did you do about it?
>         - The tech lead on their project mentioned several times that smaller PRs make things easier to develop and review. The candidate learned this lesson and is now also an advocate for that. They said they like to "aggressively" shrink work to be smaller, accomplishable, deliverable tasks.
>
> **Remote Work** [Score: TBD]
> - Two-directional Q&A [Confidence: Medium]
>     - Q: Tell us about how you manage your time and focus.
>         - They use distraction blocking software called [Freedom](https://freedom.to/) to prevent themselves from jumping over to Twitter and getting distracted. They also like working in Pomodoros. Keeping mornings clear of meetings is helpful because they feel most productive then.
> > - Reference: Ashish [Confidence: Low]
>      - talked about working remote with the candidate for brief periods of time, they did affirm that communication was frequent and detailed. No concerns were raised about this arrangement.
>
> ### **Core Role Skills**
>
> **Breaking Down Tasks** [Score: TBD]
> - Homework Discussion: Chat App [Confidence: Low]
>     - They made it to the middle of Part 2 with tests for all of the functionality they implemented and minimal styling.
>     - It looks like they didn't break the tasks into smaller, vertical pieces given the result and commit messages
>
> **Maintainable Code** [Score: TBD]
> - Homework Discussion: Chat App [Confidence: High]
>     - Code looks legible with good identifiers, small-ish functions, and reasonably well modeled data.
> - Collaborate: Refactoring and Testing [Confidence: High]
>     - Identified that a specific architecture choice meant that this logic would have many reasons to change, making it harder to maintain
>     - We talked a bit about how they like the SOLID principles
>     - I mentioned that as a team, we do like to follow SRP and OCP, but the others aren't often discussed explicitly
>
> **Refactoring** [Score: TBD]
> - Collaborate: Refactoring and Testing [Confidence: High]
>     - Suggested better identifiers, method extractions, dead code elimination.
>     - All of their suggestions sounded pretty good to me
>
> **Working with Existing Code** [Score: TBD]
> - Collaborate: Refactoring and Testing [Confidence: High]
>     - They suggested writing some outside tests first, then refactoring the inside to be more legible.
>
> **UI Component Architecture** [Score: TBD]
> - Homework Discussion: Chat App [Confidence: Medium]
>     - Components are used for high-level encapsulation, but not much for re-use or low-level encapsulation
>     - The templates would read better with more components extracted out
>
> **UI Component Development** [Score: TBD]
> - Homework Discussion: Chat App [Confidence: High]
>     - The components themselves were pretty straight-forward
>
> **CSS Implementation** [Score: TBD]
> - Homework Discussion: Chat App [Confidence: Medium]
>     - There's only basic styling, which makes sense given how far they made it into the funciontality.
>     - Used BEM style and stuck to it throughout
>
> **Testing** [Score: TBD]
> - Homework Discussion: Chat App [Confidence: Medium]
>     - Tests appear to essentially cover all implemented behavior
>     - Descriptions clearly describe what is being tested
>     - Some identifiers could be a little clearer about what values they contain; `value` is not a great name
> - Collaborate: Refactoring and Testing [Confidence: Medium]
>     - We also talked about general testing strategy. They mentioned enjoying writing by Justin Searls [on the topic](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki). They follow the Detroit School TDD methodology.
> - Collaborate: API Design [Confidence: Low]
>     - N/A
>
> **API Design** [Score: TBD]
> - Collaborate: API Design [Confidence: High]
>     - Jessie struggled a bit on identifying a good solution to the problem. With some assistance, we arrived at a pretty good solution.
>
> **Culture: Empathy and Understanding for Past Decisions** [Score: TBD]
> - Collaborate: Refactoring and Testing
>     - They made no comments about how dumb/whatever the existing solution was
      - When I asked them to think about how the code ended up this way to begin with, they gave a thoughtful answer about possible limited expertise, timelines, or just small changes over time.

#### Debrief and Scoring

With all that data in place, the only thing left is to talk about the candidate among everyone involved in hiring. Hold a meeting where you discuss the details of the scorecard and make a final decision.

It's important to keep in mind that the data you gathered and the decision you will make is not perfect. Avoid judgement phrases like "this person is bad at breaking down larger tasks". Instead, say things like "what we saw of their ability to break down tasks was not strong". This leaves the judgement open.

Skill by skill, talk about the candidate's demonstration of that skill and determine a score. A score can be "great", "solid", or "poor". Keep in mind the data points you have and your confidence in those data points.

Scores should reflect the level of the role the candidate is applying for. If you have a career ladder and/or job definitions that enumerate skills, use those definitions to determine these scores.

Create a summary for your scorecard.

</details>

The scorecard is broken up into General Skills that we think most/all team members should have and Core Role Skills, which for a Software Engineer includes a lot of technical implementation skills as well as product and design collaborative skills.

I'd love to dig into each skill in detail, but this is already going to be too long. Let's accept for now that these skills could be anything and discuss how we score candidates at a higher level.


## Phase 5: Make a Decision

*Phase Goal: Decide to pass or make an offer on a candidate.*

The information gathered so far should be focused on the candidate's strengths that match the employer's needs. If the candidate did well in the selected areas, you can be more confident that you've seen them at their best. If they did not, maybe they aren't as strong in those areas as they think they are.

Making a decision from here is easier than a standard one-size-fits-all interview, in our experience with the two formats.

{{TODO: Hiring Decision Process with Scorecard}}

This candidate looks like a great fit. We decide to hire them and make them an offer.


<details open>
<summary>‚úâÔ∏è <b>Subject: Offer from FlashRecruit!</b> [Sean -> Jessie]</summary>

> *To: Jessie*<br>
> *From: Sean*<br>
> *Date: 2019-03-06*
>
> ---
>
> **Hello Jessie!**
>
> We were very impressed with you during your interview and would like to make you an offer!
>
> Please see the offer letter attached. We hope you accept!
>
> We hope to have a response within a week, but if you need more time to make this very important decision, let us know and we can find something that works best for everyone.
>
> Let me know if you have any questions.

</details>


Then, the candidate hopefully accepts and everyone is excited to have them start!


# The End

That's the Strength-finding Interview! I hope you find this useful.

This is the result of research, experimentation, and iteration across years of work, quite often in collaboration with [@Trek](https://twitter.com/trek). You can read [Trek's earlier take](https://medium.com/@trek/tired-engineering-interviews-hired-engineering-auditions-5f9f00147a57) on this format, as well.

I consider this to be an evolving process. If you have questions or feedback, please let me know!


## Feedback from Candidates So Far

Candidate feedback on the process for both those who were successful and those who weren't has been outstanding. Everyone appreciated the goals of the format as well as the execution of it.

As interviewers, we felt much more confident in our offers and rejections. On rejections specifically: it was compelling to see a candidate claim a specific strength, us to shape the interview around that strength, then the evaluation come back as sub-par for that strength.

When we reject someone, we try to give some notes about why. There's potential legal risk in these kinds of conversations--so have them with care and approval from the responsible parties in your organization. If you can provide feedback to rejected candidates, please do so.

When we accept someone, we try to use this assessment as a starting point for their internal continuous improvement through performance management. We plan to get to a place where the interview counts as a partial assessment in the performance management cycle. But, that's a topic for another time.
