## show format

The show will run weekly,
Wednesday nights at 9pm central time.

The show will have a host (me!)
and a cohost that may change per week.
We plan to spotlight
interesting pull requests,
blog posts,
announcements,
and/or other news.

There will always be a primary topic
that in some way involves open source.
However, unlike traditional podcasts,
there will also be a mumble chat server
set up to allow anyone to interact with the hosts!

This format was inspired by the awesome
[Linux Unplugged](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/linuxun/)
program.

## participate!

The pilot episode will be on
July 16th at 9pm central time.

If you want to be a part of the mumble room,
show up 30 minutes early for mic checks.
Once the show starts,
we won't have time to check mics
and add more people to the mumble room.

Server details will be updated here
before the event. Stay tuned!
