## show format

The show will run weekly,
Wednesday nights at 9pm central time.
You can chat during the show on
[irc.freenode.net #opensourcehangout](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23opensourcehangout&uio=d4).

The show will have a host (me!)
and a cohost that may change per week.
We plan to spotlight
interesting pull requests,
blog posts,
announcements,
and/or other news.

There will always be a primary topic
that in some way involves open source.
However, unlike traditional podcasts,
we'll try to invite the community to
participate in the discussion!

## participate

If you want to be a part of the discussion,
we need to invite you when the event starts.

saying that you would like to particiapte.
Google Hangouts has a cap of 10 participants.
If we have more than that,
we'll probably do first-come first-served.

There is no cap on the number of viewers!
