This year, I didn't get an idea and team together
until very late in the process,
despite [my own advice against that](http://massalabs.com/dev/2013/10/30/how-to-hackathon.html).
It took me quite a long time to come up with an idea that could
(1) be done in 48 hours and
(2) showcases Node.js in some way.

## Jarvis

We eventually decided to build a tool that
I've wanted to exist for some time.
The goal is to have a single place that allows you to
consume any type of content.
That includes RSS feeds,
youtube videos,
podcasts,
images,
articles,
and whatever else you can find on the internet.

If every site implemented RSS in such a way that
I could subscribe to the strict subset of content I want,
this tool would not be necessary.
Sadly, RSS is often ignored or implemented globally for a site,
paying no mind to categories of content.

Jarvis lets you work around that issue.
Take a look at the pitch video.

Jarvis is also open source!
We need to do some post-hackathon code cleanup,
then we'll be ready to fix a few things,
and add some features!

The biggest things for the near future are:

* code cleanup (mostly around the data model for sources and items)
* don't re-add things that were removed
* twitter favorites should auto parse
* [dex](https://github.com/EndangeredMassa/Dex) integratino
* ability to view and remove sources

Let me know what you'd like to see below!
