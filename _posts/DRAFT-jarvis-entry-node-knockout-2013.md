Another year, another Node Knockout!
This year, I didn't get an idea and team together
until very late in the process,
despite [my own advice against that](http://massalabs.com/dev/2013/10/30/how-to-hackathon.html).
It took me quite a long time to come up with an idea that could
(1) be done in 48 hours and
(2) showcases Node.js in some way.

We eventually decided to build a tool that
I've wanted to exist for some time.
