This year, I didn't get an idea and team together
until very late in the process,
despite [my own advice against that](http://massalabs.com/dev/2013/10/30/how-to-hackathon.html).
It took me quite a long time to come up with an idea that could
(1) be done in 48 hours and
(2) showcases Node.js in some way.

## Jarvis

We eventually decided to build a tool that
I've wanted to exist for some time.
The goal is to have a single place that allows you to
consume any type of content.
That includes RSS feeds,
youtube videos,
podcasts,
images,
articles,
and whatever else you can find on the internet.

If every site implemented RSS in such a way that
I could subscribe to the strict subset of content I want,
this tool would not be necessary.
Sadly, RSS is often ignored or implemented globally for a site,
paying no mind to categories of content.

Jarvis lets you work around that issue.
