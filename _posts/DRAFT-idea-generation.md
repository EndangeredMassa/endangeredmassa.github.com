  Coming up with ideas for new projects can be hard.
  This is especially true when you need ideas for
  a hackathon.

## The Act
You should be keeping an Idea Notebook.
This can be a physical notebook, which I prefer,
or some note taking program on your smart devices.
Whatever it is, it should always be with you.
You never know when you are going to have a great idea!

This notebook should allow you to express yourself
as well as possible.
For me, that means lined and dotgrid paper,
which the
[Penny Arcade First Party notebooks](http://store.penny-arcade.com/products/first-party-notebook-set)
provide.

Once you have this, record your ideas all the time.
Some people get a nice notebook,
then are afraid to write anything in it.
Paper (or digital notes) is cheap.
Don't be afraid to write down your ideas!

- tagging
- page numbers
- front matter
- revisiting


## The Inspiration
- solve a personal need
- get inspired by others
- get inspired by actual others (other industries)


## The Failure

- sometimes you can't think of the right thing and that's ok


## The Success

- the best ideas are those you are excited about
- and those that you can get others excited about
