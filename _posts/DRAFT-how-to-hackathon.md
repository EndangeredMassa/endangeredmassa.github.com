Below are my points of advice for anyone particpating in a hackathon.
This information draws on my experience
of many hackathons in previous years.
I learned from most of these mistakes myself.

## Preparation

**Know the Rules**:
These things have rules
and it's very important to know what they are.
Read the rules in full.
There are often suggestions or requirements in the rules
that you had not considered.

**Develop Your Idea**:
If allowed, come up with your idea ahead of time.
Spend time before the event coming up with a plan of attack.
This can include learning libraries or tools ahead of time.

**Have a Goal**:
All of your work during the event should be prioritized toward some goal.
Before the event, you need to know what that goal is.
It could be to win the entire hackathon,
win a specific category,
to build something just so that it exists,
or to have fun.
Whatever it is, figure it out before you start!


## Execution

**Use a Project Template**:
https://github.com/michaelficarra/coffeescript-project
http://expressjs.com/guide.html#executable
http://html5boilerplate.com/
create your own!

**Deploy First, Then Often**:
test deploy process first
deploy often during development
Execution: Commit Like Crazy
make use of git
commits
branches
merge/rebase
revert
learn these better before the event

**Don’t Ignore Architecture**:
never going too fast
even in 24-48 hours, you will save time

**Use Existing Libraries**:
now is not the time to rewrite existing libraries

**Don’t Necessarily Ignore TDD**:
decide when to test, when to not
make sure you are set up to test

**Don’t Ignore Meatspace**:
eat
drink (caffeine, water)
sleep

**Schedule Distractions**:
remove real-time distractions
schedule real breaks for food, fun

**Pair Appropriately**:
pair on hard problems
distribute tedious work

**Avoid New Accounts**:
allow guest usage (use cookie tracking)
allow social media account access

**Support Multiple Users**:
if your app requires multiple users to demo well:
prioritize naive AI users
schedule times where judges can use the app with you

**Leave Time for Testing**:
schedule 2+ hours before the end to deploy and test


## Reflection

**Record a Demo**:
show best case scenario
show core, compelling features
be quick, but not too fast
don’t waste time with
introductions
account creation
other trivial features

**Marketing**:
take to your social media accounts
Reflection: Blog About It
writing is a great way to internalize, reflect
Core Advice
take care of your body
always have a goal
always prioritize work toward goal
