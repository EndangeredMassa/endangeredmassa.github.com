- part of several hackathons
- learned from these mistakes myself



## Preparation
- know the rules

Preparation: Have an Idea
what do you want to exist?
what is the platform well suited for?
what is likely to impress?

Preparation: Have a Goal
winning
winning a category
building something just to have it

Preparation: Indirect Construction
think through architecture
build open source components ahead of time
learn new tools and libraries before the event



## Execution

Execution: Use a Project Template
https://github.com/michaelficarra/coffeescript-project
http://expressjs.com/guide.html#executable
http://html5boilerplate.com/
create your own!

Execution: Deploy First, Then Often
test deploy process first
deploy often during development
Execution: Commit Like Crazy
make use of git
commits
branches
merge/rebase
revert
learn these better before the event

Execution: Don’t Ignore Architecture
never going too fast
even in 24-48 hours, you will save time

Execution: Use Existing Libraries
now is not the time to rewrite existing libraries
Execution: Don’t Necessarily Ignore TDD
decide when to test, when to not
make sure you are set up to test

Execution: Don’t Ignore Meatspace
eat
drink (caffeine, water)
sleep

Execution: Schedule Distractions
remove real-time distractions
schedule real breaks for food, fun

Execution: Pair Appropriately
pair on hard problems
distribute tedious work

Execution: Avoid New Accounts
allow guest usage (use cookie tracking)
allow social media account access

Execution: Support Multiple Users
if your app requires multiple users to demo well:
prioritize naive AI users
schedule times where judges can use the app with you

Execution: Leave Time for Testing
schedule 2+ hours before the end to deploy and test


## Reflection

Reflection: Record a Demo
show best case scenario
show core, compelling features
be quick, but not too fast
don’t waste time with
introductions
account creation
other trivial features

Reflection: Marketing
take to your social media accounts
Reflection: Blog About It
writing is a great way to internalize, reflect
Core Advice
take care of your body
always have a goal
always prioritize work toward goal
