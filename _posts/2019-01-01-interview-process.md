---

Most interviews seem to be Me-finding Interviews: the interviewers are looking for others who share their values, virtues, and unkowingly their vices. The format is also often very rigid, looking for specific things and rejecting candidates who can't demonstrate them.

I think we can do better. I know many are trying, too! I'm not setting up a straw man here. I just want to share my take on doing better.

What follows is (hopefully) a better default. If you agree with the goals of this format, feel free to use it as a starting point in your own interview process.


# Goals

The differentiating goal is to find the overlap between your team's needs and a candidate's strengths, then plan the specific candidate's interview to highlight those strengths.

The other goals are to:
- be as accurate as possible within the constraints of time expectations
- remove bias from the process as much as possible
- provide a fair and consistent experience to candidates
- be transparent throughout

You may notice that "plan the specific candidate's interview" and "provide a ... consistent experience to candidates" are at odds, but we'll find a compromise.


# Summary

The key takeaways are:

- ask the candidate what their strengths are, then tailor the interview towards the overlap between those and your needs
- be flexible in format, tech stack, and time
- be consistent wherever possible


# A Job and a Candidate

Let's assume we have a candidate Jessie:

<details open>
<summary>üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª <b>Candidate: Jessie</b></summary>

> Education: Self-taught<br>
> Experience: 4 years web development<br>
>
> - Worked on chat software before
> - Designed and implemented APIs in Node.js
> - Implemented web applications in React
> - Wrote API documentation
> - Managed API project by breaking down tasks

who is applying for this Software Engineer job:

<details open>
<summary>üìã <b>Job: Software Engineer</b></summary>

> FlashRecruit is a funded recruitment technology startup with massive traction (SaaS based) looking for a Software Engineer (for full stack development) to join our growing team! We're building chat-based (and other) software to make the job seeking and recruiting experiences better.
>
> **Opportunity**
>
> You are invited to join us on this adventure! There is a unique opportunity here to not only be a part of what we're building, but to influence the direction we take. You will be able to contribute your different skill sets to the various problems we'll solve together.
>
> In this role specifically, you'll be collaborating with the development team to build new features, new products, and iterate on our processes. These efforts will directly lead to happier customers and more sales for the business.
>
> We'd love to tell you more about what to expect, but the team is small and growing. It's hard to predict what the future will hold. Joining now gives you an opportunity to shape that future.
>
> **Context**
>
> We work in the recruiting software landscape, which is complex and crowded. We're doing something unique in the space by offering the ability to chat with a recruiter before applying to a job, which is exciting. However, we're not stopping there.
>
> We're also a small startup, which means you'll likely wear different hats at different times. We expect you to spend most of your time writing software, but sometimes other hats will be necessary.
>
> Not everyone works in our Oak Brook (and soon downtown Chicago) office. We fully embrace remote work. You will be collaborating with others that could be working anywhere in the US. Because of this, communication is key. This includes screen sharing, remote pair programming, writing documentation, virtual meetings, and more.
>
> **Expectations of You**
>
> There aren't many technical requirements. We don't want to exclude you based on something you could learn quickly enough on the job. Instead, we'd like to focus on the interpersonal skills that we find to be critical to team happiness and success.
>
> **Continuous Improvement:** For each other item, you don't have to already be great. The core expectation and real requirement is that you improve over time. The processes and expectations in place will facilitate that, but you should be driven to continuous improvement as well.
>
> **Code:** Writing software is the core of this role. You should write software that is tested, modifiable, and clear. We have no expectations around computer science concepts, but you should be open to learning about anything useful.
>
> **Worked on Web Software:** You should have built web applications or the systems supporting them before. Experience with our entire stack is not necessary. It is helpful to have some experience with at least one of these:
>
> *   Node.js (API)
> *   React (Web Client)
> *   React Native (Mobile Apps)
> *   AWS (Infrastructure)
>
> **Collaborate:** You should work well in a collaborative environment. As a team, we'll be building software, reviewing code, deciding on architecture, and iterating on our processes. You don't have to do all of these things, but we'd like you to be involved with the team more than just executing individual task after task.
>
> **Write:** Because we fully embrace remote work, you will often be writing messages, pull request descriptions, the occasional document, and more. Technical Writing is an important skill in general, but especially in a remote environment.
>
> **Give Feedback:** You should give feedback on the product, team, and team members. Feedback should be specific, actionable, and timely. For individuals, it should also be directly related to the job they are expected to perform. You should also be mindful of your biases when giving feedback.
>
> **Receive Feedback:** You should respond well to feedback. Responding well can mean many things, including disagreement. We want to build a strong, trust-and-respect-based relationship across the team that allows us to give feedback about actions, not judgements about people.
>
> **Benefits**
>
> *   Competitive compensation
> *   Equity in a funded, early-stage startup poised for exponential growth
> *   Full-time W2 employment
> *   Health Care Plan that's good for families and individuals
> *   Flexible time to allow for a work-life balance that works for you and your family
> *   Unlimited PTO with minimums to prevent burnout
> *   Intentionally Guided Culture based on inclusion and respect
> *   Remote work options
>
> If you aren't sure if you should apply, please apply anyway. Don't self-select yourself out. We'd be happy to discuss any concerns you have with the job post matching your skill set.
>
> FlashRecruit is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.

# Interview Process

There are five phases to the process. They will look pretty typical, but the details are where the magic happens.

```
Phase 1: Confirm Expectations
Phase 2: Interview Negotiation
Phase 3: Strength Finding Interview
Phase 4: Review and Follow Ups
Phase 5: Make a Decision
```


## Phase 1: Confirm Expectations

*Phase Goal: Confirm expectations of the candidate and employer regarding the work, growth, and compensation.*

Schedule a 30-minute call to with the candidate to discuss the work environment, growth of the candidate, direction of the business, and compensation expectations.

> Hey Jessie! Let's use this time to cover the following.
>
> Topics:
> - work: collaborating in a remote environment
> - growth: what you are looking for in your next role
> - direction: where FlashRecruit comes from and where it's going
> - compensation: expectations, not history
> - dealbreakers: absolute requirements
>
> I'm also happy to discuss any other questions you have about the role!
>
> Interview Process: {{link to full description of process}}<br>
> Job Description: {{link to the job description}}

</details>


Let's explore those topics in more detail.

**Work:** Discuss the current working environment including culture, physical/remote space, collaboration, and project management. Discuss the candidates preferences in those areas.

**Growth:** Discuss where the candidate believes they are in their career and skillsets. Discuss where they'd like to go in the future.

**Direction:** Discuss where the company is heading from both a product and business perspective.

**Compensation:** Discuss the compensation expectations of the candidate and the compensation range of the position. Include stock, bonus, and benefits. Make it clear that you do not discuss compensation history.

**Deal Breakers:** Discuss any absolute requirements that either you have for the candidate or they have for employment. These must be clearly discussed in this phase.

Near the end of the call, remind the candidate of the next steps. Ask them if they have any final questions.

Make note of any follow up tasks you may want to do. These can be anything that will help you decide on whether or not to advance the candidate to the next phase.

> - ask HR: what's the largest life insurance policy we offer?

</details>

After completing your follow ups, you should be certain that a candidate should or should not progress to the next phase. If you are not, you either have more follow ups to do or should just pass on the candidate.


## Phase 2: Interview Negotation

*Phase Goal: Assess the candidate at their best in a well-structured, fair way.*


### Collaborate on the Format

This phase starts with a request for information from the candidate. The request boils down to "what are your strengths that overlap with our needs?"

> - iterating a relational-database-backed API
> - iterating a web client for a job board
> - iterating a web chat widget
> - rethinking the job board
>
> Please send me your thoughts on what your strengths are and what would best highlight them. This doesn't have to be lengthy. We'll work together to get a set list in place. Then we'll tailor the interview to that list.
>
> Example Strengths:
>
> - Data Modeling a user and authentication system with a focus on security
> - Finding and fixing poor DB performance
> - Turning a bug report into an actionable bug fix
> - TDDing a feature end to end
> - Refactoring a too-large model
> - Breaking down large tasks into smaller ones
> - Optimizing a UX flow
> - Designing new views
>
> Then, we'll schedule the actual interview. We like to book 4 hours for that, but if that large of a block of time doesn't work, we can split it up.
>
> If coding in an interview setting won't show you at your best, we can provide a homework problem for you to tackle or you can provide a suitable work sample. In those alternative cases, the scheduled interview would involve talking through the choices you made on that problem.
>
> If you have any questions or concerns about any of this, please let me know.

> ~Sean Massa

</details>

The candidate will respond with their strengths. If they shared some relevant strengths, select a couple to build into the interview. If not, either (1) select less relevant strengths as a way to assess their ability to master something or (2) follow up with them to see if there are other strengths you could focus on.

</details>


### Interview Modules

Interview Modules are how you can find balance between consistent and adaptive interview experiences for candidates. The format is flexible around which modules are chosen, but a given module should remain as consistent as possible across candidates.

**Selction:** Some modules will still apply to most candidates. In our interviews, we typically do the same 2 modules for everyone, then leave room for 2 other modules to be flexible towards the candidate's strengths. Modules should also span technical implementation skills as well as collaboration/communication skills.

**Format:** Collaboration is very important. If the candidate is comfortable with it, try to make at least 1 large module involve collaboration with a team member. If the candidate doesn't feel comfortable with this, ask for a work sample or completion og a homework problem that you can discuss during the interview.

**Construction:** As you use this process more, you'll build more and more modules. This will require some work, but it's also worth the effort. When building modules, try to make them as realistic as possible. The domain should be the same or analgous to your domain by default, although you can shift this per candidate too. The tasks should be representative of the work required to do the job.

For our job, we could really use someone with strong API Design and high-quality execution. We also want to assess how well they will work in a remote environment.

Let's set up an interview that highlights the candidate's "API Design" and "Testing". We always ask for a technical writing sample and the homework problem includes a writing section as well. We can dig further into how well the candidate works in a remote environment during the Q&A, as well.

## Phase 3: Strength-finding Interview

Now we run the actual interview. This phase includes your common interview fare. You have a schedule, you meet, you discuss, you collaborate, and you evaluate.

In the break before the Two-directional Q&A, review your notes to find areas where you'd like to dig deeper.

> **API Design**
>
> There are essentially two skills being tested here: UI Architecture Design and React Execution. On the React Execution parts, Jessie could tell me in detail how the system would work. On the UI Architecture Design parts, Jessie struggled a bit on identifying a good solution to the problem. With some assistance, we arrived at a pretty good solution.
>
> **Refactoring and Testing**
>
> They suggested writing some outside tests first, then refactoring the inside to be more legible. Suggested better identifiers, method extractions, dead code elimination.
> 
> We also talked about general testing strategy. They mentioned enjoying Justin Searls' [writing on the topic](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki). They follow the Detroit School TDD methodology.
> 
>
> **Two-directional Q&A**
>
> 1. Tell us about a time when you felt that you didn‚Äôt collaborate well. Why? What did you do about it?
> 
>     There was a coworker they would pair with that would not often contribute to the discussion or code. The candidate received feedback that the coworker wasn't comfortable with TDD and also wasn't comfortable bringing this up to the candidate. After talking it through, they realized that they could be more accomodating to other styles. Now, they try to alternate driver/navigator more often and are more flexible around testing style, while still teaching others about what they find valuable in TDD.
> 
> 2. Tell us about a time when you received some important feedback. How did you received it? What did you do about it?
> 
>     The tech lead on their project mentioned several times that smaller PRs make things easier to develop and review. The candidate learned this lesson and is now also an advocate for that. They said they like to "aggressively" shrink work to be smaller, accomplishable, deliverable tasks.
> 
> 3. Tell us about a time when you had to solve a hard software problem. What made it hard? How did you approach solving it?
> 
>     While working in a chat system, agents would talk to customers, but there were also monitors of chats. There could be up to 4-way chats. Monitors could be silent or coaching. Some chat messages could be seen by everyone and others only by staff. There were no tests, making development hard. Debugging was especially difficult.
> 
>     They decided to add a lot of tests around this area. In doing so, they discovered several bugs and made the system easier to maintain. They now champion 
> 
> 4. Tell us about how you manage your time and focus.
> 
>     They use distraction blocking software called [Freedom](https://freedom.to/) to prevent themselves from jumping over to Twitter and getting distracted. They also like working in Pomodoros. Keeping mornings clear of meetings is helpful because they feel most productive then.

## Phase 4: Review and Follow Ups

*Phase Goal: Fill in the assessment gaps.*

No matter how much effort you reasonably put into the process, there will be times that Phase 2 does not produce enough information to make a decision. This can come from poor execution of an interview module, poor choice of interview module, candidate nerves getting in the way, or other mishaps.

Review the data gathered from the interview and decide if this candidate is a clear hire, decline, or it's unclear. If it's unclear, figure out what missing information you have.

The candidate may also have requests for additional information. Common requests at this stage include:
- candidate requesting to meet other team members
- hiring manager requesting running a different module
- hiring manager requesting supporting evidence of a skill

Schedule any new modules that make sense and run them just like in Phase 3. Gather any relevant information and add it to the notes. After that's all run, go through Phase 4 again.

</details>


## Phase 5: Make a Decision

*Phase Goal: Decide to pass or make an offer on a candidate.*

The information gathered so far should be focused on the candidate's strengths that match the employer's needs. If the candidate did well in the selected areas, you can be more confident that you've seen them at their best. If they did not, maybe they aren't as strong in those areas as they think they are.

Making a decision from here is easier than a standard one-size-fits-all interview. The actual framework for making this decision is not the focus of this article, but it should be based on consistent processes that aim to remove bias in the hiring process.

# Feedback

Candidate feedback on the process for both those who were successful and those who weren't has been outstanding. Everyone appreciated the goals of the format as well as the execution of it.

As interviewers, we felt much more confident in our offers and rejections. On rejections specifically: it was compelling to see a candidate claim a specific strength, us to shape the interview around that strength, then the evaluation come back as sub-par for that strength.

When we reject someone, we try to give some notes about why. There's potentiatl legal risk in these kinds of conversations--so have them with care and approval from the responsible parties in your organization. If you can provide feedback to rejected candidates, please do so.


# The End

That's the Strength-finding Interview! I hope you find this useful.

This is the result of research, experimentation, and iteration across years of work, quite often in collaboration with [@Trek](https://twitter.com/trek). You can read [Trek's earlier take](https://medium.com/@trek/tired-engineering-interviews-hired-engineering-auditions-5f9f00147a57) on this format, as well.

I consider this to be an evolving process. If you have questions or feedback, please let me know!
