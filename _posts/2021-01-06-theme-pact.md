# Theme Pact: How I'm Setting Goals in 2021

Setting goals is important, but difficult. I never feel like I have enough data to estimate proper terms for a goal to make it motivating instead of ignorable or daunting.

- Should my goal be to reduce build times by 15% or 20%?
- Should I achieve this by the end of the month or quarter?
- What happens if I or the business decide that's not important between then and now? 
- What happens if I literally can't complete this because of technical or logistical reasons?

I'll spare you my long (and boring) history with struggling to answer these questions and deal with the consequences of them. The point is that I (at least) need to either find a way to work within the typical framework or find a new one that works for me.

I've tried the first approach for many years. It's time to try the second.

## What is a Theme?

*This concept comes from the [Theme System](https://www.thethemesystem.com), developed by [Myke Hurley](https://twitter.com/imyke) and [CGP Grey](https://twitter.com/cgpgrey/) through [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex).*

Myke and CGP Grey define the Theme system in intentionally vague terms. They want users to use their framework to build a more specific system for themselves. The core of this framework is:

**Yearly Themes:** A theme defined with a name, description, and a set of ideal outcomes.

**Journal Pages:** A daily journal with a series of prompts intended to spark insight and review in your process.

**Daily Themes:** A daily habit or progress tracker for specific things you want to do each day. These can be marked as not complete, partially complete, or complete.

I'll get into the Journal Pages and Daily Themes later. For the Theme itself, I put more detail into it for my system:

**North Star:** A theme is a North Star. It's a default position. When you come to a decision in your life, you ask yourself, does one of the choices lead me towards my theme? If so, that is your default decision. You can still obviously choose something else, but defaults have incredible power.

**Resonant:** A theme resonates with you as a deep desire for a high-level focus in your life. This can be some major thing you want to change, improve, or maintain.

**Flexible:** A theme is flexible. It can adjust to life (and sometimes world) changes.

**Infallible:** A theme is infallible. You cannot fail. It's a direction, not a destination.


## What is a PACT?

*This concept comes from [SMART goals are not so smart: make a PACT instead](https://nesslabs.com/smart-goals-pact)* by [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://twitter.com/anthilemoon) through [Ness Labs](https://twitter.com/ness_labs).

Anne-Laure defines a PACT Goal as:

**Purposeful:** A PACT Goal calls out to a purpose in your life, similar to how a Theme should be Resonant. Aligning your PACT goals to your Theme will accomplish this by proxy.

**Actionable:** A PACT Goal is be actionable. It focuses on outputs instead of outcomes to keep you in control of your progress on this goal.

**Continuous:** A PACT Goal is continuous. It is something you can do periodically and frequently.

**Trackable:** A PACT Goal is trackable. There should be some measure of either (1) whether or not you did a thing or (2) how many times you did a thing.

I extend this further to include:

**Accountable:** My PACT Goals are accountable. I choose a person who knows about my goal and can prod me when I'm not making progress on it.

**Unblocked:** My PACT Goals make note of their potential blockers. I list out reasons why I might fail to meet this goal.

**Planned:** My PACT Goals make note of specific strategies I will take to (1) complete the goal at all and (2) work around or prevent any blockers.

**Habitual:** My PACT Goals are habitual. They either rely on existing habits to trigger new behavior or define new habits I need to instill in order to accomplish the goal.


## My Way: The Theme Pact


Premise:
- a single north star to provide vision
- a couple specific strategies for moving toward that vision
- systems in place to ensure work happens
- systems in place to adjust for failure
