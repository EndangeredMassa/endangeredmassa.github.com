# Theme Pact: How I'm Setting Goals in 2021

Setting goals is important, but difficult. I never feel like I have enough data to estimate proper terms for a goal to make it motivating instead of ignorable or daunting.

- Should my goal be to reduce build times by 15% or 20%?
- Should I achieve this by the end of the month or quarter?
- What happens if I or the business decide that's not important between then and now? 
- What happens if I literally can't complete this because of technical or logistical reasons?

I'll spare you my long (and boring) history with struggling to answer these questions and deal with the consequences of them. The point is that I (at least) need to either find a way to work within the typical framework or find a new one that works for me.

I've tried the first approach for many years. It's time to try the second.

## My PACT Theme Framework

Pulling from several sources, cited later, my framework for goal settings includes:

- Theme: a guiding light, a default decision
- PACT Goals: specific outputs I commit to
- Habits: systems for making sure I achieve those outputs

This leverages the power of direction, defaults, and habits to build an engine where success happens as a matter of course. Well, that's the theory.


## What is a Theme?

*This concept comes from the [Theme System](https://www.thethemesystem.com), developed by [Myke Hurley](https://twitter.com/imyke) and [CGP Grey](https://twitter.com/cgpgrey/) through [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex).*

Myke and CGP Grey define the Theme System in intentionally vague terms. They want users to use their framework to build a more specific system for themselves.

The themes themselves are defined with a name, description, and a set of ideal outcomes. They call them "yearly themes" for convenience, but these can be seasons, quarters, or whatever works best for you.

For my purposes, I decided a theme has to be:

**North Star:** A theme is a North Star. It's a default position. When you come to a decision in your life, you ask yourself, does one of the choices lead me towards my north star? If so, that is your default decision. You can still obviously choose something else, but defaults have incredible power.

**Resonant:** A theme resonates with you as a deep desire for a high-level focus in your life. This can be some major thing you want to change, improve, or maintain.

**Flexible:** A theme is flexible. It should not be overly specific. It can adjust to life (and sometimes world) changes.

**Infallible:** A theme is infallible. You cannot fail. It's a direction, not a destination.


## My Theme: Year of the Engine

My Theme for the next quarter or so is Year of the Engine". (I may still change the name.)

I want to instill in my life this core engine that can be used to produce significant change. To do that, I have to make significant change to get the engine in place.

Next up, we'll set some PACT goals in this direction. This quote from James Clear (of [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) fame) really drives how how I feel about setting goals.

> You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.


## What is a PACT?

*This concept comes from [SMART goals are not so smart: make a PACT instead](https://nesslabs.com/smart-goals-pact)* by [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://twitter.com/anthilemoon) through [Ness Labs](https://twitter.com/ness_labs).

Anne-Laure defines a PACT Goal as:

**Purposeful:** A PACT Goal calls out to a purpose in your life, similar to how a Theme should be Resonant. Aligning your PACT goals to your Theme will accomplish this by proxy.

**Actionable:** A PACT Goal is be actionable. It focuses on outputs instead of outcomes to keep you in control of your progress on this goal.

**Continuous:** A PACT Goal is continuous. It is something you can do periodically and frequently.

**Trackable:** A PACT Goal is trackable. There should be some measure of either (1) whether or not you did a thing or (2) how many times you did a thing.

I extend this further to include:

**Accountable:** My PACT Goals are accountable. I share my goal with someone who can prod me when I'm not making progress on it.

**Unblocked:** My PACT Goals make note of their potential blockers. I list out reasons why I might fail to meet this goal.

**Planned:** My PACT Goals make note of specific strategies I will take to (1) complete the goal at all and (2) work around or prevent any blockers.

**Habitual:** My PACT Goals are habitual. They either rely on existing habits to trigger new behavior or define new habits I'll need to develop in order to accomplish the goal.

The last step to defining a PACT goal is figuring out how you can act on it right now. Can you reach out to someone, schedule an event, buy something you'll need, or something else?
