# The Strength-finding Interview

Most interviews seem to be Me-finding Interviews: the interviewers are looking for others who share their values, virtues, and unkowingly their vices. The format is also often very rigid, looking for specific things and rejecting candidates who can't demonstrate them.

I think we can do better. I know many are trying, too! I'm not setting up a straw man here. I just want to share my take on doing better.

What follows is (hopefully) a better default. If you agree with the goals of this format, feel free to use it as a starting point in your own interview process.


# Goals

The differentiating goal is to find the overlap between your team's needs and a candidate's strengths, then plan the specific candidate's interview to highlight those strengths.

The other goals are to:
- be as accurate as possible within the constraints of time expectations
- remove bias from the process as much as possible
- provide a fair and consistent experience to candidates
- be transparent throughout

You may notice that "plan the specific candidate's interview" and "provide a ... consistent experience to candidates" are at odds, but we'll find a compromise.


# Interview Process

There are four phases to the process. They will look pretty typical, but the details are where the magic happens.

```
Phase 1: Confirm Expectations
Phase 2: Strength Finding Interview
Phase 3: Follow Ups
Phase 4: Meet the Founders / Make Offer
```

## Phase 1: Confirm Expectations

*Phase Goal: Confirm expectations of the candidate and employer regarding the work, growth, and compensation.*

Schedule a 30-minute call to with the candidate to discuss the work environment, growth of the candidate, direction of the business, and compensation expectations.

Example Meeting Agenda:

> Topics:
> - work: collaborating in a remote environment
> - growth: what you are looking for in your next role
> - direction: where FlashRecruit comes from and where it's going
> - compensation: expectations, not history
> - dealbreakers: absolute requirements
>
> I'm also happy to discuss any other questions you have about the role!
>
> Interview Process: {{link to full description of process}}
>
> Job Description: {{link to the job description}}

**Work:** Discuss the current working environment including culture, physical/remote space, collaboration, and project management. Discuss the candidates preferences in those areas.

**Growth:** Discuss where the candidate believes they are in their career and skillsets. Discuss where they'd like to go in the future.

**Direction:** Discuss where the company is heading from both a product and business perspective.

**Compensation:** Discuss the compensation expectations of the candidate and the compensation range of the position. Include stock, bonus, and benefits. Make it clear that you do not discuss compensation history.

**Dealbreakers:** Discuss any absolute requirements that either you have for the candidate or they have for employment. These must be clearly discussed in this phase.

Near the end of the call, remind the candidate of the next steps. Ask them if they have any final questions.

Make note of any follow up tasks you may want to do. These can be anything that will help you decide on whether or not to advance the candidate to the next phase, such as:

- reference calls
- reviewing new information
- following up with HR about insurance details
- another candidate call to continue a previous agenda item

After completing your follow ups, you should be certain that a candidate should or should not progress to the next phase. If you are not, you either have more follow ups to do or should just pass on the candidate.


## Phase 2: Strength Finding Interview

*Phase Goal: Assess the candidate at their best in a well-structured, fair way.*

### Collaborate on the Format

This phase starts with a request for information from the candidate. The request boils down to "what are your strengths that overlap with our needs?"

Example email:

> **Hello [name]!**
>
> Welcome to Phase 2 of our interview process!
>
>     Phase 1: [Audio Call] Match Expectations
>     **Phase 2: [Video Interview] Strength Finding Interview**
>     Phase 3: [Variable] Follow Ups
>     Phase 4: [Video Call] Meet the Founders
>
> The goal here is to really highlight your strengths. Take some time think about what your strengths are, what our problem domain looks like, and how those overlap.
>
> Our stack is:
>
> - Node.js (API)
> - React (Web Client)
> - React Native (Mobile Apps)
> - AWS (Infrastructure)
>
> Our problem space is the recruiting software landscape. We're currently focused on improving our job board and streamlining customer onboarding.
>
> That means:
>
> - integrating with third party APIs
> - building and running recurring processing tasks
> - consuming XML feeds
> - iterating a relational-database-backed API
> - iterating a web client for a job board
> - iterating a web chat widget
> - rethinking the job board
>
> Please send me your thoughts on what your strengths are and what would best highlight them. This doesn't have to be lengthy. We'll work together to get a set list in place. Then we'll tailor the interview to that list.
>
> Example Strengths:
>
> - Data Modeling a user and authentication system with a focus on security
> - Finding and fixing poor DB performance
> - Turning a bug report into an actionable bug fix
> - TDDing a feature end to end
> - Refactoring a too-large model
> - Breaking down large tasks into smaller ones
> - Optimizing a UX flow
> - Designing new views
>
> Then, we'll schedule the actual interview. We like to book 4 hours for that, but if that large of a block of time doesn't work, we can split it up.
>
> If coding in an interview setting won't show you at your best, we can provide a homework problem for you to tackle or you can provide a suitable work sample. In those alternative cases, the scheduled interview would involve talking through the choices you made on that problem.
>
> If you have any questions or concerns about any of this, please let me know.
>
> Thanks!
>

The candidate will respond with their strengths. If they shared some relevant strengths, select a couple to build into the interview. If not, either (1) select less relevant strengths as a way to assess their ability to master something or (2) follow up with them to see if there are other strengths you could focus on.

Example Candidate Response:

> My Strengths:
>
> - Data Modelling
> - API Design
> - System Architecture
> - Breaking Large Tasks into Smaller Tasks
>
> I don't typically do well programming in an interview setting. Can we do the homework problem you mentioned instead? I'm most comfortable with React and Node.js.

For an example job, suppose that API Design and Task Management are key skills.

You should have a standard set of skills you want to evaluate, like a form of technical execution and a form of communication.

You may end up with something like the following.

```
Intro (5m)
Architecture Overview (10m)
Homework Discussion: Chrome Extension Project (1hr)
Collaborate: Redesigning the Job board (1hr)
Collaborate: Refactoring and Testing Discussion (30m)
Two-directional Q&A (45m)
```



### Running the Interview

On my team, we value technical writing, especially given the remote team dynamics. Because of this, we also request a technical writing sample.




## Phase 3: Follow Ups

*Phase Goal: Fill in the assessment gaps.*

No matter how much effort you reasonably put into the process, there will be times that Phase 2 does not produce enough information to make a decision. This can come from poor execution of an interview module, poor choice of interview module, candidate nerves getting in the way, or other mishaps. Instead of declining what may be an excellent candidate, Phase 3 is here to course correct.

The candidate and hiring manager can both request additional interview sessions for any of those reasons. Common requests at this stage include:
- candidate requesting to meet other team members
- hiring manager requesting running a different module
- hiring manager requesting supporting evidence of a skill

Schedule any new modules that make sense and run them just like in Phase 2.


## Phase 4: Make a Decision

*Phase Goal: Decide to pass or make an offer on a candidate.*

The information gathered so far should be focused on the candidate's strengths that match the employer's needs. If the candidate did well in the selected areas, you can be more confident that you've seen them at their best. If they did not, maybe they aren't as strong in those areas as they think they are.

Making a decision from here is easier than a standard one-size-fits-all interview. The actual framework for making this decision is not the focus of this article, but it should be based on consistent processes that aim to remove bias in the hiring process.
