---

Most interviews seem to be Me-finding Interviews: the interviewers are looking for others who share their values, virtues, and unkowingly their vices. The format is also often very rigid, looking for specific things and rejecting candidates who can't demonstrate them.

I think we can do better. I know many are trying, too! I'm not setting up a straw man here. I just want to share my take on doing better.

What follows is (hopefully) a better default. If you agree with the goals of this format, feel free to use it as a starting point in your own interview process.


# Goals

The differentiating goal is to find the overlap between your team's needs and a candidate's strengths, then plan the specific candidate's interview to highlight those strengths.

The other goals are to:
- be as accurate as possible within the constraints of time expectations
- remove bias from the process as much as possible
- provide a fair and consistent experience to candidates
- be transparent throughout

You may notice that "plan the specific candidate's interview" and "provide a ... consistent experience to candidates" are at odds, but we'll find a compromise.


# A Job and a Candidate

Let's assume we have a candidate Jessie:


> **Candidate: Jessie**
> 
> Education: Self-taught<br>
> Experience: 4 years web development<br>


who is applying for this Software Engineer job:


> **Job: Software Engineer**
> 
> FlashRecruit is a funded recruitment technology startup with massive traction (SaaS based) looking for a Software Engineer (for full stack development) to join our growing team! We're building chat-based (and other) software to make the job seeking and recruiting experiences better.
> 
> **Opportunity**
> 
> You are invited to join us on this adventure! There is a unique opportunity here to not only be a part of what we're building, but to influence the direction we take. You will be able to contribute your different skill sets to the various problems we'll solve together.
> 
> In this role specifically, you'll be collaborating with the development team to build new features, new products, and iterate on our processes. These efforts will directly lead to happier customers and more sales for the business.
> 
> We'd love to tell you more about what to expect, but the team is small and growing. It's hard to predict what the future will hold. Joining now gives you an opportunity to shape that future.
> 
> **Context**
> 
> We work in the recruiting software landscape, which is complex and crowded. We're doing something unique in the space by offering the ability to chat with a recruiter before applying to a job, which is exciting. However, we're not stopping there.
> 
> We're also a small startup, which means you'll likely wear different hats at different times. We expect you to spend most of your time writing software, but sometimes other hats will be necessary.
> 
> Not everyone works in our Oak Brook (and soon downtown Chicago) office. We fully embrace remote work. You will be collaborating with others that could be working anywhere in the US. Because of this, communication is key. This includes screen sharing, remote pair programming, writing documentation, virtual meetings, and more.
> 
> **Expectations of You**
> 
> There aren't many technical requirements. We don't want to exclude you based on something you could learn quickly enough on the job. Instead, we'd like to focus on the interpersonal skills that we find to be critical to team happiness and success.
> 
> **Continuous Improvement:** For each other item, you don't have to already be great. The core expectation and real requirement is that you improve over time. The processes and expectations in place will facilitate that, but you should be driven to continuous improvement as well.
> 
> **Code:** Writing software is the core of this role. You should write software that is tested, modifiable, and clear. We have no expectations around computer science concepts, but you should be open to learning about anything useful.
> 
> **Worked on Web Software:** You should have built web applications or the systems supporting them before. Experience with our entire stack is not necessary. It is helpful to have some experience with at least one of these:
> 
> *   Node.js (API)
> *   React (Web Client)
> *   React Native (Mobile Apps)
> *   AWS (Infrastructure)
> 
> **Collaborate:** You should work well in a collaborative environment. As a team, we'll be building software, reviewing code, deciding on architecture, and iterating on our processes. You don't have to do all of these things, but we'd like you to be involved with the team more than just executing individual task after task.
> 
> **Write:** Because we fully embrace remote work, you will often be writing messages, pull request descriptions, the occasional document, and more. Technical Writing is an important skill in general, but especially in a remote environment.
> 
> **Give Feedback:** You should give feedback on the product, team, and team members. Feedback should be specific, actionable, and timely. For individuals, it should also be directly related to the job they are expected to perform. You should also be mindful of your biases when giving feedback.
> 
> **Receive Feedback:** You should respond well to feedback. Responding well can mean many things, including disagreement. We want to build a strong, trust-and-respect-based relationship across the team that allows us to give feedback about actions, not judgements about people.
> 
> **Benefits**
> 
> *   Competitive compensation
> *   Equity in a funded, early-stage startup poised for exponential growth
> *   Full-time W2 employment
> *   Health Care Plan that's good for families and individuals
> *   Flexible time to allow for a work-life balance that works for you and your family
> *   Unlimited PTO with minimums to prevent burnout
> *   Intentionally Guided Culture based on inclusion and respect
> *   Remote work options
> 
> If you aren't sure if you should apply, please apply anyway. Don't self-select yourself out. We'd be happy to discuss any concerns you have with the job post matching your skill set.
> 
> FlashRecruit is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.


# Interview Process

There are four phases to the process. They will look pretty typical, but the details are where the magic happens.

```
Phase 1: Confirm Expectations
Phase 2: Strength Finding Interview
Phase 3: Follow Ups
Phase 4: Meet the Founders / Make Offer
```


## Phase 1: Confirm Expectations

*Phase Goal: Confirm expectations of the candidate and employer regarding the work, growth, and compensation.*

Schedule a 30-minute call to with the candidate to discuss the work environment, growth of the candidate, direction of the business, and compensation expectations.


> **Calendar Invite: "Call: Sean <> Jessie"**
>
> *To: Jessie*<br>
> *From: Sean*<br>
> *Date: 2019-03-01 9:30 - 10:00am*
>
> ---
> 
> Topics:
> - work: collaborating in a remote environment
> - growth: what you are looking for in your next role
> - direction: where FlashRecruit comes from and where it's going
> - compensation: expectations, not history
> - dealbreakers: absolute requirements
>
> I'm also happy to discuss any other questions you have about the role!
>
> Interview Process: {{link to full description of process}}
>
> Job Description: {{link to the job description}}


Let's explore those topics in more detail.

**Work:** Discuss the current working environment including culture, physical/remote space, collaboration, and project management. Discuss the candidates preferences in those areas.

**Growth:** Discuss where the candidate believes they are in their career and skillsets. Discuss where they'd like to go in the future.

**Direction:** Discuss where the company is heading from both a product and business perspective.

**Compensation:** Discuss the compensation expectations of the candidate and the compensation range of the position. Include stock, bonus, and benefits. Make it clear that you do not discuss compensation history.

**Deal Breakers:** Discuss any absolute requirements that either you have for the candidate or they have for employment. These must be clearly discussed in this phase.

Near the end of the call, remind the candidate of the next steps. Ask them if they have any final questions.

Make note of any follow up tasks you may want to do. These can be anything that will help you decide on whether or not to advance the candidate to the next phase.


> **Candidate Notes: Jessie**
> 
> *Date: 2019-03-01*
>
> ---
> 
> Work: They've not worked full-time in a remote environment before,
> but have worked remotely on their team for up to a week at a time.
> They enjoyed it and felt productive during that time.
> 
> Growth: They would like to grow in technical leadership skills, such as mentorship, giving good feedback, and breaking down complex tasks.
> 
> Compensation: They seemed amenable to our compensation range for the position,
> but would prefer higher equity and lower salary, given a choice.
> 
> Deal Breakers: Not interested in working somewhere that uses "go fast and break things"
> to mean "write bad code and move on".
> 
> To Do:
> - reference call: Ashish about working a remote environment
> - ask HR: what's the largest life insurance policy we offer?


After completing your follow ups, you should be certain that a candidate should or should not progress to the next phase. If you are not, you either have more follow ups to do or should just pass on the candidate.


## Phase 2: Strength Finding Interview

*Phase Goal: Assess the candidate at their best in a well-structured, fair way.*


### Collaborate on the Format

This phase starts with a request for information from the candidate. The request boils down to "what are your strengths that overlap with our needs?"


> **Subject: FlashRecruit Interview Process**
> 
> *To: Jessie*<br>
> *From: Sean*<br>
> *Date: 2019-03-02*
> 
> ---
>
> **Hello Jessie!**
>
> Welcome to Phase 2 of our interview process!
>
>     Phase 1: [Audio Call] Match Expectations
>     **Phase 2: [Video Interview] Strength Finding Interview**
>     Phase 3: [Variable] Follow Ups
>     Phase 4: [Video Call] Meet the Founders
>
> The goal here is to really highlight your strengths. Take some time think about what your strengths are, what our problem domain looks like, and how those overlap.
>
> Our stack is:
>
> - Node.js (API)
> - React (Web Client)
> - React Native (Mobile Apps)
> - AWS EC2/RDS/S3 (Infrastructure)
>
> Our problem space is the recruiting software landscape. We're currently focused on improving our job board and streamlining customer onboarding.
>
> That means:
>
> - integrating with third party APIs
> - building and running recurring processing tasks
> - consuming XML feeds
> - iterating a relational-database-backed API
> - iterating a web client for a job board
> - iterating a web chat widget
> - rethinking the job board
>
> Please send me your thoughts on what your strengths are and what would best highlight them. This doesn't have to be lengthy. We'll work together to get a set list in place. Then we'll tailor the interview to that list.
>
> Example Strengths:
>
> - Data Modeling a user and authentication system with a focus on security
> - Finding and fixing poor DB performance
> - Turning a bug report into an actionable bug fix
> - TDDing a feature end to end
> - Refactoring a too-large model
> - Breaking down large tasks into smaller ones
> - Optimizing a UX flow
> - Designing new views
>
> Then, we'll schedule the actual interview. We like to book 4 hours for that, but if that large of a block of time doesn't work, we can split it up.
>
> If coding in an interview setting won't show you at your best, we can provide a homework problem for you to tackle or you can provide a suitable work sample. In those alternative cases, the scheduled interview would involve talking through the choices you made on that problem.
>
> If you have any questions or concerns about any of this, please let me know.
>
> Thanks!
>
> ~Sean Massa


The candidate will respond with their strengths. If they shared some relevant strengths, select a couple to build into the interview. If not, either (1) select less relevant strengths as a way to assess their ability to master something or (2) follow up with them to see if there are other strengths you could focus on.


> **Subject: My Strengths**
>
> *To: Sean*<br>
> *From: Jessie*<br>
> *Date: 2019-03-03*
>
> ---
> 
> These are my strengths that seem to overlap with your needs:
>
> - Technical Writing
> - API Design
> - Outside-in TDD of a Feature
> - System Architecture Design
> - Breaking Large Tasks into Smaller Tasks
>
> I don't typically do well programming in an interview setting. Can we do the homework problem you mentioned instead? I'm most comfortable with React and Node.js.


For our job, we could really use someone with strong API Design and high-quality execution. Let's set up an interview that highlights the cadnidates "API Design" and "TDD" skills.

### Module Selection

Modules are how you can find balance between consistent and adaptive interview experiences for candidates.




### Running the Interview





## Phase 3: Follow Ups

*Phase Goal: Fill in the assessment gaps.*

No matter how much effort you reasonably put into the process, there will be times that Phase 2 does not produce enough information to make a decision. This can come from poor execution of an interview module, poor choice of interview module, candidate nerves getting in the way, or other mishaps. Instead of declining what may be an excellent candidate, Phase 3 is here to course correct.

The candidate and hiring manager can both request additional interview sessions for any of those reasons. Common requests at this stage include:
- candidate requesting to meet other team members
- hiring manager requesting running a different module
- hiring manager requesting supporting evidence of a skill

Schedule any new modules that make sense and run them just like in Phase 2.


## Phase 4: Make a Decision

*Phase Goal: Decide to pass or make an offer on a candidate.*

The information gathered so far should be focused on the candidate's strengths that match the employer's needs. If the candidate did well in the selected areas, you can be more confident that you've seen them at their best. If they did not, maybe they aren't as strong in those areas as they think they are.

Making a decision from here is easier than a standard one-size-fits-all interview. The actual framework for making this decision is not the focus of this article, but it should be based on consistent processes that aim to remove bias in the hiring process.
