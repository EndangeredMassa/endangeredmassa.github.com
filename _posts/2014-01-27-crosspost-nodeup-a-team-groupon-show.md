blurb:
   I was on <a href="http://nodeup.com/fiftyeight">NodeUp</a>
   with
   <a href="https://twitter.com/dshaw">Daniel Shaw</a>,
   <a href="https://twitter.com/mcculloughsean">Sean McCullough</a>,
   and <a href="https://twitter.com/ageitgey">Adam Geitgey</a>
   talking about
   <a href="https://engineering.groupon.com/2013/misc/i-tier-dismantling-the-monoliths/">Groupon's move to Node.js</a>.
   
   This was my first podcast appearance,
   which was pretty exciting.
   
   We talked about several things,
   but my focus was promoting
   <a href="https://github.com/groupon/testium">testium</a>!
