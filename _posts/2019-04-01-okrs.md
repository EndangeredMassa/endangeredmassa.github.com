- determine the vision
- determine the mission
- company okrs
- department okrs
  - most should align, but not all have to
  - sometimes split responsibility for a given company KR
  - sometimes copy down a given company KR
  - if lots of copying, could mean:
    - your department is just a major focus of the company right now
    - your company OKRs were too specific to your department
- process throughout quarter
  - record metrics before retros (Thursday night right now)
  - dev retro with dev-focused OKR review
  - product retro with dev items and product-focused OKR review
  - write weekly review email with all that data
  - company OKR review twice per quarter (for now)
