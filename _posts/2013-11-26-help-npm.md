title: "Help npm Keep the Lights On"
author: Sean Massa
categories: [dev]
blurb:
  npm single-handedly enables Node.js
  module distribution and consumption.
  Without it, we would be lost.
  Help keep the lights on
  by donating to the project!

[Nodejitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/) runs [npmjs.org](https://npmjs.org/)
as a free service to the community.
The rapid growth of Node.js (and thus Node.js package usage)
means that this service costs significantly more than it once did.
This cost comes in both dollars and resources.

I feel that we, as Node.js developers, owe the npm project
almost as much as we owe the Node.js project itself.
Node.js without npm would be cool,
but it would be too hard to use.

Nodejitsu has [launched a campaign](https://scalenpm.org)
to solicit donations from the community
at both the individual and corporate level.

Please consider donating to the project personally
or through your employer.
